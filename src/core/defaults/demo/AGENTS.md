# Demo scenario instructions

## Goals
- Demo scenarios should run to a successful retirement (ending balance stays positive).
- Scenarios should not be excessively successful; in the last few years the balance should not be increasing by more than 10x expenses.
- Use simple configurations that highlight one module at a time.
- Use "Demo" in names for people, accounts, and holdings.

## Data rules
- Social Security earnings history should exist from age 20 through and including 2025.
- People start Social Security no later than age 70.
- Most spending line items should have blank start/end dates.
- Most future work strategies should include a current job with a blank start date.
- Unless demonstrating Roth features, Social Security starts when the last future work period ends.
- Starting cash balances should be within the cash buffer target range and should not trigger cash buffer actions in the first month.

## Descriptions
- Each demo scenario must include a `scenario.description` explaining what it demonstrates.
- Include specific steps/month(s)/ages to look at in the simulation run to see the module behavior.
